# 🖼️ Image-Based Steganography 🔐

This project demonstrates how to hide and extract secret text messages within images using steganography techniques, with optional encryption for added security. It is built using Python and designed to simulate a cybersecurity-focused GUI similar to Kali Linux.

## 🚀 Features

- Hide secret messages in images (PNG/JPG)
- Extract hidden messages from stego-images
- Optional password-based encryption
- CLI and GUI-based (Tkinter) versions
- Secure and simple to use

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- PIL (Pillow) for image processing
- Cryptography (Fernet) for encryption


## 💡 How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
